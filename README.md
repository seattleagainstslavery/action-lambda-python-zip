# action-lambda-python-zip

GitHub Action to make zip deployment to AWS Lambda with pip requirements in a separate layer and additional custom layers.

Forked from: [![GitHubActions](https://img.shields.io/badge/listed%20on-GitHubActions-blue.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-lambda-zip-deploy-python)

## Description
This action automatically installs requirements, zips and deploys the code including the dependencies as a separate layer.

#### Python 3.7 is supported

### Pre-requisites
In order for the Action to have access to the code, you must use the `actions/checkout@master` job before it.

### File Structure
This example workflow assumes your `requirements.txt` is in the root directory and that your functions are in folders with their function name as the directory name. Custom layers are assumed to be in a directory that matches their `custom_layer_N_path` value.

The below workflow would publish code to layers (pip and any custom layers) and functions (first_function and second_function), and finally also attach the layers to those updated functions.

For any custom layers, before the files are copied and zipped and uploaded to AWS, any custom script can be executed if it is placed inside the layer folder and named `predeploy.sh`


### Environment variables
Storing credentials as a Github secret is strongly recommended.

- **AWS Credentials**
    `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are required.

### Inputs
- `requirements_txt`
    The name/path for the `requirements.txt` file. Defaults to `requirements.txt`.
- `pip_layer_arn`
    The ARN for the Lambda layer the dependencies should be pushed to **without the version** (version will be automatically updated on AWS).
- `custom_layer_1_path`
    Something like a folder of `utils` which holds all your utility code.
- `custom_layer_1_arn`
    The ARN for the Lambda layer where this utility code will go.
- `custom_layer_2_path`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `custom_layer_2_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `custom_layer_3_path`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `custom_layer_3_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `custom_layer_4_path`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `custom_layer_4_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `public_layer_1_arn`
    The ARN of an external public Lambda layer in case you need one (e.g. https://github.com/keithrozario/Klayers).
- `public_layer_2_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `public_layer_3_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `public_layer_4_arn`
    Same as above if you need more layers.
- `lambda_function_names`
    The Lambda function names comma separated.
- `aws_region`


### Example Workflow
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Deploy code to Lambda
      uses: seattleagainstslavery/action-lambda-python-zip@v1.1
      with:
        pip_layer_arn: 'YOUR_UNIQUE_ARN:layer:LAYER_NAME'
        custom_layer_1_path: 'utils'
        custom_layer_1_arn: 'YOUR_UNIQUE_ARN:layer:LAYER_NAME'
        lambda_function_names: 'first_function,second_function'
        aws_region: 'us-east-2'
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```
